::HomeAbout
I am a student and developer with a strong interest in backend development, and experience in building fullstack web applications. While I can work on both stacks, I most enjoy designing reliable and scalable backends. Beyond web development, I have a growing fascination with Artificial Intelligence. I plan to learn the creation process, up to deploying it into real production applications. In my daily life, I apply prompt engineering when using AI tools to enhance productivity. Currently, I want to keep learning and exploring potential opportunities. Not just writing code, but building real solutions, and exploring the world of cryptocurrency.
